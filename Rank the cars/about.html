            <h1>Rank your favorite cars</h1>
            <p>In the realm of steel and asphalt, the car becomes more than a mere machine; it embodies 
                a profound bond between man and motion. For men, it is a conduit to liberation, a chariot 
                of freedom carving through the open road. In the embrace of its leather-clad seats and the 
                symphony of its engine's roar, men find solace, adventure, and escape. It is a companion that
                asks for nothing but unleashes endless possibilities, offering respite from the constraints of
                everyday life. With hands on the wheel and the wind as a witness, the car becomes an extension 
                of masculinity, a vessel of dreams realized, and the embodiment of limitless horizons waiting to be explored.
                And with any car, she brings a different level of class and bond, I created this project with a very fine choice of car collection in the gallery. <br>Play it and if you like it do share this to your friend!</p>
